# Solidity Practice

Welcome to the **Solidity Practice** repository! This project is dedicated to learning and experimenting with the Solidity programming language, which is widely used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Gain hands-on experience with Solidity.
- Explore various features and concepts of the language.
- Build and test smart contracts in a controlled environment.
- Document learnings and best practices for future reference.

## Project Structure

- **contracts/**: Contains Solidity smart contracts.
- **test/**: Test files for verifying contract functionality.
- **scripts/**: Utility scripts for interacting with the contracts.

## Learning Resources

Here are some resources to help you learn Solidity:

- [Solidity Documentation](https://soliditylang.org/docs/)
- [Ethereum Developer Resources](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/)
